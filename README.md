Project Title: CRUD API for Product Management

Description:
I have developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing product information. This project is designed to handle operations related to products, including attributes such as Product ID, Product Name, and Seller Name. Notably, the API is implemented without using a traditional database, showcasing my ability to handle data in a stateless manner.

Key Features:

Create Product: Allows for the addition of new products with unique IDs, names, and associated seller names.
Read Product: Fetches the details of all products or a specific product by ID.
Update Product: Updates the information of an existing product.
Delete Product: Removes a product from the collection based on its ID.
Technical Highlights:

Environment: Java, Servlets
Server: Apache Tomcat
Tools: Postman for API testing
Deployment: Localhost
Achievements:

Successfully designed and implemented the API from scratch.
Thoroughly tested all endpoints using Postman, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Achieved a stateless implementation without relying on a traditional database, highlighting innovative data handling techniques.
Future Enhancements:

Integrate a database to persist product data.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Develop a user-friendly front-end interface for easier interaction with the API.
Project Phase:
This project is currently in Level 1 development. Future phases will include advanced features and enhancements to further improve functionality and user experience.
